# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to the FiveDone application (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Mateusz Byrtus (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".

The Application does **not** gather precise information about the location of your mobile device.

The Service Provider may also use information you provide to contact you from time to time with important notices, required updates, or relevant information related to the Application.

Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to help the Service Provider improve the Application and its functionality. The Service Provider may share your information with third parties as described in this Privacy Policy.

The Service Provider may disclose User Provided and Automatically Collected Information:

- as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process;
- when they believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect their rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;

The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. They encourage all children to never submit personally identifiable information through the Application or Services.
